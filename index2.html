   <p class="text" id="text-13">The new AI gold rush consists of enclosing
    different fields of human knowing, feeling,
    and action—every type of available data—all
    caught in an expansionist logic of never-ending
    collection.(...)The practices of data extraction
    are extending even deeper into areas of human
    life that were once off-limits or too expensive
    to reach.</p>

    engines, presume genuine user need and thus
    also user sincerity, they primarily serve the
    interests of those who deploy them, rather than
    the needs of the users they address. ”By using
    historical data to anticipate “user wants,” they
    limit choice and amplify past trends in the
    name of efficiency and desire.” (...) “The goal
    is to provide us with items that are vaguely
    satisfying to keep us craving more. ”</p>

Our goal should be nothing less than representing the true content and structure of human thought.</p>
